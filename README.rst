tz-converter
--------

Convert the time and date across time zones.
This tool provides a simple interface for converting the time and date between two time zones. Written in Python3 and using Pyside, this interface allows the user to save a certain time zone and restore it after further changes. The timezone information is taken from pytz, supplying seven different regions: Africa, America, Asia, Australia, Europe, Pacific, and US.
